used an ensemble method of training in which multiple lower accuracy models are used simultaneously to get a better result than each individual model.
used random forest which is multiple decision trees working together to create a more accurate prediction.
we can take average of multiple decision trees to get a more accurate answer or we can use voting system .
used matplotlib and seaborn to represent most important features.
used metrics from sklearn including accuracy_score , classification_report and confusion_matrix
used Simpleimputer , onehotencoder ,standardscaler to process data from sklearn
